                <br>
                A brand new restaurant has been constructed in Alumni Court, the dining space also incorporates
                heritage-listed former Radon Laboratory, while accented with flairs inspired by its inner-city
                sister venue. Those familiar with Customs House’s iconic copper dome may notice Patina’s brass
                and copper-coloured finishes and luxe interiors that flourish in the open-air atmosphere created
                by the surrounding Alumni Gardens.

                The main lake is more than 70 years old and was built prior to much of what we know today about
                urban water systems. Thanks to scientific practice and research, the behaviours of urban lakes are
                now far better understood.

                As part of UQ’s water-quality monitoring program, water samples were taken regularly since 2010.
                There were some signs of water quality deterioration in 2018, and in early 2019, the lake experienced
                a significant blue-green algae bloom – indicating a lake out of balance and no longer able to self regulate
                back to health.
